# Learning-Rust

The idea behind this repo is just have some fun while  learning the rust programming language.

The the initial commit there's only two or three scattered files. The idea was to have one language feature at a file what would became a mess. A little after I was intuited to take a more organized path. I have just issue a `$ cargo init`, sent all rust files into src directory, deleted everything else. In order to test additional features one needs to implement it in a file inside src directory, add a mod for the new file and call his pulbic function into the main file.
